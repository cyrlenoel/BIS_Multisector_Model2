# The BIS Multisector Model: A Multi-Country Environment for Macroeconomic Analysis

This repository accompanies our paper, **“The BIS Multisector Model: A Multi-Country Environment for Macroeconomic Analysis”**, authored by Matthias Burgert, Giulio Cornelli, Burcu Erik, Benoit Mojon, Daniel Rees and Matthias Rottner.

The paper introduces the BIS Multisector Model (BIS-MS), a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model for analyzing macroeconomic dynamics in a multi-sector production network. The model can be calibrated to match the input-output data of more than 80 economies, enabling a detailed exploration of sectoral interdependencies and cross-industry shock transmission. The accompanying model toolbox equips policymakers and researchers with an easy-to-access platform for flexible scenario analysis. You can access the full paper [here](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1297.htm).

## How to Run

To use the toolbox, the users need **MATLAB**, the **MATLAB Optimization Toolbox**, and **Dynare version 5.5**. Please refer to the learning guide (BIS_Multisector_Model_Learning_Guide.pdf), which demonstrates the toolbox's capabilities through practical examples. The guide includes two key use cases:
1. Simulating a temporary shock.
2. Simulating a structural change in the economy.

These examples provide step-by-step instructions to help users effectively navigate and utilize the toolbox.
